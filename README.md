## PhantomSense
We are Phantom Sense, an R&D-driven project focused on AI-powered iot applications . Our work 
revolves around building adaptive neural networks for real-time sensor data reconstruction, enhancing 
reliability in critical systems like aerospace,power systems, automotive, and industrial monitoring.
Currently, we are developing models based on research and theoretical/proposed implementations while 
focusing on research for embedded system implementation of those models.
